Falco provides a full-featured REST API that you can use for extending Falco’s features.

We use the [OpenAPI 2.0 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) to provide the complete API docs, and [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) to run an interactive, dev-friendly version online.

If you already have installed your own Falco instance, the API docs are available at `https://<your-falco-instance-url>/swagger/`.

Otherwise, you can also see the docs on Theodo’s instance at [https://falco.theo.do/swagger/](https://falco.theo.do/swagger/).

You can also find the JSON-formatted API docs at the `/swagger.json` endpoint on your instance URL or Theodo’s.
